# LSTM-model
Develop a LSTM model for the time series forecasting using univariate sequence and
perform the following tasks.
1. Prepare the Univariate series for modelling
2. Build the LSTM model
For the univariate sequence, perform the following tasks
1. Build the Stacked LSTM model
2. Build the Bidirectional LSTM model
Compare both models performances
